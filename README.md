# UGA
Code used at UGA for research.

## DNA methylation
This is where I put most effort into. Inside there's a workflow starting from data preprocessing, and moving on to unpaired
t-tests, fitting generalized linear models, and finally GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis).

The folder also includes bisulfite sequencing data's methylation percentage calculation code. That includes genes and LINE-1 elements.

## Pathology
This is just some exercising work, downloading data from TCGA and organizing them. Deprecated.

## Warburg
*Really* important but not having any progress lately. Should be a workaround in using gene expression and Km data, rather than just biomass and concentration in cell.
