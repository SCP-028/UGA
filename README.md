# UGA
Code used at UGA for research.

## Methylation model
Inspired by [this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26000). Try to build a classifier on colorectal cancer (COAD & READ).

## Protein pKa
Calculating protein overall charge with [MCCE](http://www.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/~mcce/index.php). Note that this software only works on Intel CPUs.
Later work include estimating micro-environment pH given the protein pK values.
