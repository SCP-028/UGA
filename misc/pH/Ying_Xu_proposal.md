# Metabolic reprogramming and pH Homeostasis in Cancer
> Ying Xu

1. Cancer tissues tend to synthesize `proline` instead of uptake it, while in normal cells, only <10% prolines are synthesized
2. Glutaminolysis, increased nucleotide synthesis, inhibition of Urea cycle, increased glycosylation, decreased DNA methylation, altered protein acetylation, increased sialic acids production, decreased utilization of specific AAs, increased lipid synthesis
3. Proliferating cells need higher intracellular pH: from ~7.0 to 7.4-7.5
4. Cancer cells up-regulate the $H^+$-loading transporters (outside $\rightarrow$ inside)
    - Lactic acid transporters are special cases
5. $NAD^+$ and $NADH$ shouldn't be treated as a closed system anymore
6. Polyamine synthesis is used to release the nitrogenous waste
7. Arginine to Glutamine, basic to acidic pool
    - **Location of the Arginines in proteins**
8. Arginine and Lysine have the highest mutation rates in cancer (less used), and Glutamine is used more
9. Fenton reactions...
